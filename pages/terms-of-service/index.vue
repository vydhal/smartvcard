        <p>
          The intellectual property in the materials contained in this website
          are owned by or licensed to BizViz and are protected by applicable
          copyright and trademark law. We grant our users permission to download

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This
          license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these
          restrictions or the Terms of Service, and may be terminated by BizViz
          at any time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="font-extrabold text-2xl">User-Generated Content</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          You retain your intellectual property ownership rights over content
          you submit to us for publication on our website. We will never claim
          ownership of your content, but we do require a license from you in
          order to use it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you use our website or its associated services to post, upload,
          share, or otherwise transmit content covered by intellectual property
          rights, you grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,
          sub-licensable, worldwide license to use, distribute, modify, run,
          copy, publicly display, translate, or otherwise create derivative
          works of your content in a manner that is consistent with your privacy
          preferences and our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The license you grant us can be terminated at any time by deleting
          your content. However, to the extent that we (or our partners) have
          used your content in connection with commercial or sponsored content,
          the license will continue until the relevant commercial or post has
          been discontinued by us.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="font-extrabold text-2xl">Liability</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an 'as
          is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, BizViz makes no warranties,
          expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other
          warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or
          conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
          non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of
          rights.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In no event shall BizViz or its suppliers be liable for any
          consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party
          arising from the use or inability to use this website or the materials
          on this website, even if BizViz or an authorized representative has
          been notified, orally or in writing, of the possibility of such
          damage.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the context of this agreement, &ldquo;consequential loss&rdquo;
          includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated
          loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business,
          loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of
          reputation, loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether
          under statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence),
          indemnity, or otherwise.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
          warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
          incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="font-extrabold text-2xl">Accuracy of Materials</h3>
        <br />

        <br />
        <h3 class="font-extrabold text-2xl">Right to Terminate</h3>
        <br />

          We may suspend or terminate your right to use our website and
          terminate these Terms of Service immediately upon written notice to

        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="font-extrabold text-2xl">Severance</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Any term of these Terms of Service which is wholly or partially void
          or unenforceable is severed to the extent that it is void or
          unenforceable. The validity of the remainder of these Terms of Service
          is not affected.
