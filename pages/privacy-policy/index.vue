        <p>
          Information we collect falls into one of two categories:

        <p>
          &ldquo;Automatically collected&rdquo; information refers to any
          information automatically sent by your devices in the course of

        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain

        <br />
        <p>
          Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you

          security.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall
          security strength, ensuring the security of your own information
          within the bounds of our services. For example, ensuring you do not

          time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in
          accordance with this privacy policy. For example, if you have provided
          us with personal information such as an email address when contacting
          us about a specific enquiry, we may retain this information for the
          duration of your enquiry remaining open as well as for our own records
          so we may effectively address similar enquiries in future. If your
          personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will
          delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify
          you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
